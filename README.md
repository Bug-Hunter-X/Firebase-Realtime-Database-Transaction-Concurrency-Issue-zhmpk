# Firebase Realtime Database Transaction Concurrency Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential race condition when using Firebase Realtime Database transactions with optimistic locking.  Under high concurrency, increment operations may fail to reflect the correct final value due to overwritten transactions.

The `bug.js` file contains code that replicates this problem. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution using a more robust approach to handle concurrency.

## Reproducing the bug

1.  Set up a Firebase project.
2.  Install the Firebase JavaScript SDK.
3.  Run `bug.js`. Simulate multiple clients running this simultaneously to observe the potential for data loss.

## Solution

The proposed solution addresses concurrency problems by using server timestamps or atomic operations to ensure data integrity. See `bugSolution.js` for a potential fix.
